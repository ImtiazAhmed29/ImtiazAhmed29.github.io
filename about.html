        <p>My primary focuses center around aerospace and robotics. Video games and museum visits helped foster a fascination with aviation and space travel within me from a young age, and my interest in robotics comes from my robotics team, which introduced me to the unique abilities of autonomous machines. Since then, I've been particularly curious about the use of sensors in aircraft and robots and how data comes together to create a more complete image of an environment, and how entities respond to these inputs. I'm also interested in mechanical linkages that can function on aircraft or robots as deployment or mobility mechanisms.</p>

        <p>When I'm not working, you might find me at my local park, biking or taking pictures of interesting birds or insects. I consider myself a pretty outdoorsy person, and I've traveled to a number of national parks, but some of my favorite places to explore are the lesser known parks in NYC, like Floyd Bennett Field. I also enjoy flying my personal drone.</p>
